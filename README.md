# The Letter Z
This is the website I'll use to publicize all my projects. As much I am a pretentious asshole, I'm not stuck up enough to direct people to [my GitHub](https://github.com/theletter7a). It might be hard to believe, but most people don't know what pull requests and commits are. Check out my YouTube channel [here](https://youtube.com).
